            <h2>About Hogwart</h2>
            <p> Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is the British wizarding school, located in the Scottish
                Highlands. It takes students from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and also
                the Republic of Ireland.
                The castle is located in the mountains near a loch. The precise location of the school can never be
                uncovered because it was rendered Unplottable. To Muggles, the school looks like an old abandoned
                castle.
                Similarly, most wizarding schools locations are protected in order to prevent their ways of teaching
                being
                revealed, as well as protect the students and schools themselves from any harm.
                Established around the 10th century, Hogwarts is considered to be one of the finest magical institutions
                in
                the Wizarding World, though other notable schools included Beauxbatons Academy of Magic in France,
                the Durmstrang Institute in Scandinavia, and Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the United
                States. Children with magical abilities are enrolled at birth, and acceptance is confirmed by owl
                post at
                age eleven. However, if the child in question is a Muggle-born, a professor from the school would come
                and
                inform the child's parents.
                The school's motto is Draco Dormiens Nunquam Titillandus (Draco Dormiens Nvnqvam Titillandvs), which,
                translated from Latin, means "Never tickle a sleeping dragon".
                The three highest towers are the Astronomy, Ravenclaw, and Gryffindor ones. <!--which is set upon huge rocks above a magnificent lake.
                The castle has witnessed centuries and has a long history of ancient magic--></p>

            <p>
                Hogwarts Castle
                Hogwarts School is located in Hogwarts Castle, a large castle somewhere in the Highlands of Scotland.
                The
                castle has extensive grounds with sloping lawns, flowerbeds and vegetable patches, a loch (called
                the Black
                Lake), a large dense forest (called the Forbidden Forest), several greenhouses and other outbuildings,
                and a
                full-size Quidditch Pitch. </p>
            <p> There is also an owlery, which houses all the owls owned by the school and
                those
                owned by students.

                The
                castle is known for its many updates and changes in layout throughout the years, such as regenerating
                itself
                after the Battle of Hogwarts. It should be noted that some rooms in the school tend to "move around,"
                and so
                do the steps on the Grand Staircase. Albus Dumbledore once noted that even he did not know all of
                Hogwarts'
                secrets.
                The school has numerous charms and spells on and around it that make it impossible for a Muggle to see
                it
                as
                the school; rather, they see only ruins and several warnings of danger. Witches and wizards
                cannot Apparate or Disapparatein Hogwarts grounds, except for when the Headmaster lifts the enchantment,
                whether only in certain areas or for the entire campus, so as to make the school less vulnerable when it
                serves the headmaster to allow Apparition. Electricity and electronic devices are not found at
                Hogwarts. 
            </p>

            <!--            <p>
                            Typical school year
                            "Now… to our new students, welcome, to our old students, welcome back! Another year full of magical
                            education awaits you…"
                            —Welcoming Feast speech

                            The scarlet Hogwarts Express steam engine on Platform 9¾
                            Term begins on 1 September. Students usually reach Hogwarts via the Hogwarts Express, which leaves from
                            Platform 9¾ of London's King's Cross Station at 11 a.m. sharp. There seemed to be other ways of entering
                            the
                            school, such as via broomsticks or Floo Powder, or simply Apparating to a nearby location such
                            as Hogsmeade.
                            Missing the Hogwarts Express for any reason is a very serious problem, but will not cost the student
                            points
                            as long as they get there before the term has officially started. The Hogwarts Express brings the
                            students
                            to Hogsmeade station, where the first years traditionally cross the Black Lake in boats with
                            the gamekeeper,
                            and go under an opening in the rocks upon which Hogwarts is built, through a curtain of ivy, and finally
                            into an underground harbour.
                            Older students travel on the road in carriages pulled by Thestrals (invisible to any that hasn't
                            witnessed
                            death) to the castle. The Welcoming Feast takes place in the Great Hall. This feast includes the Sorting
                            ceremony, followed by a few words from the current Headmaster or Headmistress, the banquet starts after
                            this, including large quantities of food and drink. The feast is closed with a few more words from the
                            Headmaster or headmistress, but it also included the usual "start-of-term notices".

                    Headmistress, Minerva McGonagall until she becomes headmistress, and the house ghost is Sir Nicholas
                    de Mimsy-Porpington, more commonly known as Nearly Headless Nick. According to Rowling, Gryffindor

                     garbed in a pink dress. She permits entry only after being given the correct password, as was distinguished in

                    to the
                    element of earth. The founder of this house is Helga Hufflepuff. The entrance to the Hufflepuff

                    device that douses the illegal entrant in vinegar if the wrong lid is tapped or the rhythm is wrong. The
                    Hufflepuff common room is

    <h2 id="quidditch" class="quidditch">Something about Quidditch</h2>
    <article class="quidditch">
        <div class="text grid">
            <p>Quidditch is an exciting and dynamic game that is based on the fictional game of Quidditch popularised in
                the Harry Potter books. Played by two teams consisting of seven players each, it is designed to mirror
                the book version of the game as much as possible. The most obvious way this is done is that each player
                is
                mounted on a broomstick and attempts to win the game by having more points than their opponents by the
                time the Golden Snitch is caught (which in this version of the game, is a tennis ball in a long yellow
                sock).
                Quidditch is one of the world’s youngest games but one that is growing in popularity all the time.
                Created in 2005, Quidditch even has its own governing body, the International Quidditch Association
                (IQA) who
                are in charge of the sport’s rules and regulations. According to the IQA, the sport is now played by
                over 300
                teams in over 20 countries. The object of the game of Quidditch is to score more points than your
                opponents. Players do this by
                scoring goals which is done by placing a slightly deflated volleyball called the Quaffle into the
                opposition's
                baskets giving them 10 points, and by capturing the Golden Snitch which is worth 30 points.
                Players & Equipment In Quidditch, each team is made up of 7 players. One Seeker, one Keeper, two Beaters
                and three Chasers –</p>
            <p> each of which have a specific task. The Chasers are there to try and keep possession of the Quaffle and
                to score a goal by throwing it
                through one of the opponent’s three hoops. They can pass the ball between each other but only one is
                allowed to
                enter into the scoring zone at any one time.
                The two Beaters throw Bludgers and these are thrown at the opposition to disrupt them. The other side’s
                Beaters, in turn, throw them back with the same intention. The players in this position are usually the
                strongest and most physical within the team. The Keeper is a defensive player and is tasked with
                defending the team’s hoops.
                Lastly, the Seeker is the team member whose job is to capture the all-important Golden Snitch.
                The equipment needed to play Quidditch includes: Broomstick: All players must stay mounted on a
                broomstick, which can be made out of a variety of
                materials including wood or PVC piping. The broom must also be held between the legs all the time.
                Hoops: Three hoops are situated at each end of the pitch, all at different heights (2m, 1.4m and 1m).
                They are placed approximately two broomsticks apart with the tallest on the left. Quaffle: This is ball
                in the game that only
                Chasers and Keepers can utilise. It’s a volleyball that has been deflated and is what the Chasers must
                try to
                throw through into the hoops in order to score points. Bludgers: These are slightly deflated dodgeballs
                and can only be used by Beaters.</p>

            <p>There are three of them
                on the pitch at any one time and Beaters throw these at the opposition to ‘knock them out’, which means
                the
                opposition player has to stop what they are doing, dismount, and run back to their own hoops and touch
                them
                before resuming play.
                Golden Snitch: This is a tennis ball placed in a long yellow sock, which is then attached to a ‘Snitch
                Runner’. A ‘Snitch Runner’ is a neutral player who tries to avoid each team’s Seeker, which is the only
                position to be able to catch the Golden Snitch. Capturing the Golden Snitch ends the game immediately.
                Scoring
                There are two ways to score during a game of Quidditch. Firstly, the Chasers can score a goal by getting
                possession of the Quaffle, then entering the opposition's scoring area and throwing it successfully
                through
                one of the three hoops. This gives the team 10 points. The second way to score points is for the Seeker
                to
                gain possession of the Golden Snitch. Doing so, scores the team 30 points and immediately ends the game.
                Winning the Game
                There is a common misunderstanding in Quidditch that the team that captures the Golden Snitch is the
                team
                that wins the match. This is technically incorrect, as the winner of the match is the team with the most
                points.
                Because the Snitch is worth 30-points and the game ends as soon as it is captured, the winner is almost
                always the team that captured it. This is not always the case, however, as technically, a team can still
                win
                the game even if they haven’t captured the Golden Snitch just as long as they have more points than the
                opposing team.</p>
